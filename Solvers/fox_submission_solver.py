    Note that: 
        1. Once you requested a riddle you cannot request it again per game. 
        2. Each riddle has a timeout if you didnot reply with your answer it will be considered as a wrong answer.
        3. You cannot request several riddles at a time, so requesting a new riddle without answering the old one
          will allow you to answer only the new riddle and you will have no access again to the old riddle.

            2.a. At most one real message is sent
